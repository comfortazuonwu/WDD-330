        <li>The getAttribute method returns the value of the attribute while the setAttribute changes the value of the element's attribute.</li>

    <h2>Chapter 7: Events</h2>
    <ul>
   
        <li>Events provide the link between the webpage and the user interactions. </li>
        <li>When an event triggers an event handler, a callback function is called. </li>
        <li> The most common types of events are mouse, keyboard and touch events. </li>
        <li>The preventDefault method of the event object can stop a default behavior happening. Some events do not allow the default behavior to be prevented.</li>
        <li>The default behaviour of event propagation is bubbling. Bubbling can be stopped from occuring by adding the event.stopPropagation method</li>
    </ul>
