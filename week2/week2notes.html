    <h2>Week Two Notes</h2>
    <h2>Chapter 2:Programming Basics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I learned something new about reserved words that cannot be used to name variables</li>
      <li>“const” is used if the value of the variable will not be changed while “let” is used if the variable will be reassigned later.</li>
      <li>Variable names should be sensible and should describe what it represents. They are also case sensitive</li>
      <li>Interpolation means that an expression (e.g. a variable) can be inserted inside a string and the result of that expression will be displayed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Questions:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>I still don’t understand the concept behind a global scope and a local scope. What does it mean for a variable to be declared inside or outside a block?</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Chapter 3:Arrays,Logic and Loops</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Items in an array are not fixed. They can be changed. We can also have different data types in an array</li>

        <li> I also didn't know that the shift, unshift and push methods existed </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Questions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The book talked about converting a set to an array. Is it possible to convert an array to a set?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Chapter 4: Functions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All functions must return a value.</li>
        <li>I learned something new about default parameters which can be used when no arguments are provided for the function.</li>
        <li> A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <p>I have no questions on the chapter</p>
