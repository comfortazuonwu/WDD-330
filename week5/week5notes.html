    <h2>Chapter 10: Debugging</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that helps the program deal with the error.</li>
      <li>An exception produces a stack trace which is a sequence of methods or functions that lead to the cause of problems. </li>
      <li>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur and fixing them.</li>
      <li>Breakpoints can be very useful when trying to track down bugs in your code. </li>
      <li>Testing your code makes it less brittle and helps identify bugs early. </li>
    </ul>
